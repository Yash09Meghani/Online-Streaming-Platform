My Dashboard - https://github.com/Yash09Meghani/Online-Streaming-Platform/blob/main/Online%20Streaming%20Platform.png

This dashboard analyzes over 9,600 titles across 518 genres and 5,700 directors. It shows that movies make up 81% of the dataset, with drama and comedy as the leading genres. The trend analysis highlights a sharp rise in production after 2000, especially for movies. I built it to showcase skills in data analysis and dashboard designâ€”turning raw data into clear insights with interactive visuals like maps, trend lines, and filters.
